# PRNConsumerDemo
To invoke the application, type at a Terminal command prompt:

java -jar PRNConsumerDemo.jar

Be sure that you provide all kafka_2.11-1.0.0 jars in the "lib" subfolder. 

Kafka properties (host id, buffer size, time-out etc.) are hard-coded, they can 
be alternated in ConsumerUtils.java file.
